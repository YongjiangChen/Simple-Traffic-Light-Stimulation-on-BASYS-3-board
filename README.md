# Simple-implementation-on-a-BASY-3-FPGA-board
This Project aims to design and implement three traffic lights on a BASYS-3 board. The simulated Traffic Lights follow the British Traffic Standards. I used both LEDs and VGA display to display the traffic light signals and pedestrian crossing light as well as the pedestrian waiting light.
